The custom domain {{ domain }} has now been registered to your account.

Document root: /public/home/{{ target.crsid }}/{% if root %}{{ root }}{% else %}public_html{% endif %}

Any files or content in this directory will be served from your newly configured domain.  You may need to wait up to 20 minutes before you can access the site.

If you haven't done so already, you should configure your domain's DNS records to resolve to our server.  More info can be found here:
